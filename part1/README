Instructions to run the solutions:
----------------------------------

1. For question 1: Run make q1 to build target and run once. Run ./q1 to run it again. We use regular expressions to count the no. of words, special characters, tabs, spaces an lines. Run ./q1 < sample_input_q1.txt for testing with a sample paragraph.

2. For question 2: Run make q2 to build target and run once. Run ./q2 to run it again. We design a DFA with 4 states (0,1,2,3) with 0 as initial state and 0,2 as final states. Also, a error state(state -1) is included for invalid inputs (i.e., characters other than '0' and '1').
	Transition table:
	-------------------
		   Inputs
	-------------------
	State   '0'	'1'
	-------------------
	0	 1	 3	
	1	 0	 2
	2	 3	 1
	3	 2	 0
	-------------------
	
3. For question 3: Run make q3 to build target and run once. Run ./q3 to run it again. We design a DFA with 2 states (0,1) with 0 as initial state and 1 as the final state. Also, a error state(state -1) is included for invalid inputs (i.e.,character other than 'a' and 'b').
	Transition table:
	-------------------
		   Inputs
	-------------------
	State   'a'	'b'
	-------------------
	0	 0	 1	
	1	 1	 0
	-------------------
	
4. For question 4: Run make q4 to build target and run once. Run ./q4 to run it again. We design a DFA with 4 states (0,1,2,3) with 0 as initial state and 2 as the final state. Also, a error state(state -1) is included for invalid inputs (i.e., characters other than 'a' and 'b').
	Transition table:
	-------------------
		   Inputs
	-------------------
	State   'a'	'b'
	-------------------
	0	 3	 1	
	1	 2	 1
	2	 2	 1
	3	 3	 3
	-------------------

5. For question 5: Run make q5 to build target and run once. Run ./q5 to run it again. We design a DFA with 8 states (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) with 0 as initial state and 4,5,6,7 as final states. Also, a error state(state -1) is included for invalid inputs (i.e., characters other than 'a' and 'b').
	Transition table:
	-------------------
		   Inputs
	-------------------
	State   'a'	'b'
	-------------------
	0	 0	 1	
	1	 2	 1
	2	 0	 3
	3	 4	 1
	4	 5	 6	
	5	 5	 7
	6	 4	 7
	7	 4	 7
