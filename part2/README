Points to Note:
---------------

Q6: Run the command make q6 to compile and run for the first time and later,
    we can run the command ./q6 to run the program again.
    Limitations: Program only works for +, -, *, / operations only and
    not for modulus or exponentiation or ++/-- operations.

Q7: Run the command make q7 to compile and run for the first time and later,
    we can run the command ./q7 to run the program again.
    Limitations: Program only works for cases where each non-terminal is on the
    left hand side of atmost two production rules. We combine all the production
    rules of a non-terminal while giving input. Eg: X->XY|Z

Q8: Run the command make q8 to compile and run for the first time and later,
    we can run the command ./q8 to run the program again.
    Limitations: Program only works for cases where each non-terminal is on the
    left hand side of atmost two production rules. We combine all the production
    rules of a non-terminal while giving input. Eg: X->XY|Z

Q9: Run  the command make q9 to compile and run for the first time and later,
    we can run the command ./q9 to run the program again.
    Limitations: Program only works for +, -, *, /, = operations only and
    not for () or modulus or exponentiation or ++/-- operations.

Q10: Run  the command make q10 to compile and run for the first time and later,
    we can run the command ./q10 to run the program again.
    Limitations: Program only works for +, -, *, /, = operations only and
    not for () or modulus or exponentiation or ++/-- operations.
